## Introduction
This is a simple prototype of Smart Wheelchair. The wheelchair is multi functional. It can be used for various purposes. This chair can be used as panic alarm. If the person needs instant help, he/she can hit the panic alarm button so that someone can help him/her immediately. This wheelchair has ability to  automatically identify the obstacles and it makes decision to go with the obstacle free path.
