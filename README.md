## Challenges faced and how to overcome it
  1.   In this mini project we need to operate the vehicle manually with the help of joystick. We can overcome this manual work by using sensors to sense the human brain activities and opearte accordingly.
  2.   Heavy components used to build electric wheelchairs can be replaced by this smart embedded wheelchair which is light in weight.
  3.   Tracking of the vehicle and route finder using GPS Module can overcome the limitation of inability to track and retrieve data stored in the lost vehicle
